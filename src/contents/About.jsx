        <h4>Hey there!</h4>
        <h1>My name is Najla Parker</h1>
        <h3>Full Stack Web Developer</h3>
        <br></br>
        <p> Welcome! My name is Najla Parker and I am currently working as a program planner in the Program
          Management
          Organization within Raytheon Technologies. I have spent the last 7 years working in the defense
          contractor
          industry
          supporting various types of programs and honing my project management skills.
        </p>

        <p> After working with
          software
          development teams and participating in the timing of releases, increment planning and observing the
          backlog grooming
          sessions; I decided it was my turn! This is what led me to join the 24 week Coding Bootcamp at The
          University of Denver.
        </p>

        <p> I have acquired skills in the fundamental concepts of web development (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), as
          well
          as command line fundamentals and APIs. In addition, I am learning to engineer a full-stack web
          application, working with servers, databases, and other back end technologies, and connecting them to the
          front end.
        </p>

        <br></br>

        <p>
          I look forward to a lifetime of learning and evolving as well as the opportunity to problem solve. These
          are my favorite aspects of
          being a developer thus far and something I employ daily in my current role. As I continue the journey to
          become a
          full stack developer, I am keeping an open mind and trying to discover what I most enjoy.
